Refocus React router task

Goal:
Develop a single-page app for a website on the topic of your choice. The website should contain the navbar and tab buttons, which help users navigate pages. Use the React Router library with nested routes. Make at least two layout components and several pages.

The navbar is the upper menu. It represents the main website sections.

The tab buttons help users navigate between pages inside the main sections. For example, the “Projects” page can have the “Townhouse” and “Condominium” subpages.
